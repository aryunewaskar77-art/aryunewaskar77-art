## 👋 My Journey

I’m carving my own path in the tech world. Beyond the classroom, I'm constantly pushing boundaries with modern tech stacks and real-world projects. I believe in the power of "Learning Through Failure," where every bug is a lesson and every challenge is an opportunity to improve. My goal is to build software that isn't just functional, but truly elegant and user-centric.
